# ADDM-A-Divine-Divinity-Mod
ADDM is Pronounced as Adam
Repository for ADDM divine divinity mod versions.

Offical repository for ADDM mod series. I will host the main branch and its versions here, sometimes some offshoots will be stored here, like those who have access problems or a small group who want a specifiec change.

I am looking for scripters, if you can script than please get in contact with me, get the tools, play around with them and inform me of what is possible and what is not. I will work with you, your abilities and your limitations.

I am also interested in community input for future versions of ADDM. I would like to know what is sacred to the community (areas to not touch for example), and what areas overall bother the community as a whole.
